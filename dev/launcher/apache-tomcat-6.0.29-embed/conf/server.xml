<!-- Example Server Configuration File -->
<!-- Note that component elements are nested corresponding to their
    parent-child relationships with each other -->

<!-- A "Server" is a singleton element that represents the entire JVM,
    which may contain one or more "Service" instances.  The Server
    listens for a shutdown command on the indicated port.
    
    Note:  A "Server" is not itself a "Container", so you may not
    define subcomponents such as "Valves" or "Loggers" at this level.

    <!-- A "Service" is a collection of one or more "Connectors" that share
        a single "Container" (and therefore the web applications visible
        within that Container).  Normally, that Container is an "Engine",
        but this is not required.
        
        Note:  A "Service" is not itself a "Container", so you may not
        define subcomponents such as "Valves" or "Loggers" at this level.

    <!-- Define the Tomcat Stand-Alone Service -->
    <Service name="Catalina">

        <!-- A "Connector" represents an endpoint by which requests are received
            and responses are returned.  Each Connector passes requests on to the
            associated "Container" (normally an Engine) for processing.
            
            By default, a non-SSL HTTP/1.1 Connector is established on port 8080.
            You can also enable an SSL HTTP/1.1 Connector on port 8443 by
            following the instructions below and uncommenting the second Connector
            entry.  SSL support requires the following steps (see the SSL Config
            HOWTO in the Tomcat 5 documentation bundle for more detailed
            instructions):
            * If your JDK version 1.3 or prior, download and install JSSE 1.0.2 or
            later, and put the JAR files into "$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/ext".
            * Execute:
            %JAVA_HOME%\bin\keytool -genkey -alias tomcat -keyalg RSA (Windows)
            $JAVA_HOME/bin/keytool -genkey -alias tomcat -keyalg RSA  (Unix)
            with a password value of "changeit" for both the certificate and
            the keystore itself.
            
            By default, DNS lookups are enabled when a web application calls
            request.getRemoteHost().  This can have an adverse impact on
            performance, so you can disable it by setting the
            "enableLookups" attribute to "false".  When DNS lookups are disabled,
            request.getRemoteHost() will return the String version of the
            IP address of the remote client.
