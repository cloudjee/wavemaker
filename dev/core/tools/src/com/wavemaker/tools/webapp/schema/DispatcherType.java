/**
 * 
 * 
 * 	The dispatcher has four legal values: FORWARD, REQUEST, INCLUDE,
 * 	and ERROR. A value of FORWARD means the Filter will be applied
 * 	under RequestDispatcher.forward() calls.  A value of REQUEST
 * 	means the Filter will be applied under ordinary client calls to
 * 	the path or servlet. A value of INCLUDE means the Filter will be
 * 	applied under RequestDispatcher.include() calls.  A value of
 * 	ERROR means the Filter will be applied under the error page
 * 	mechanism.  The absence of any dispatcher elements in a
 * 	filter-mapping indicates a default of applying filters only under
 * 	ordinary client calls to the path or servlet.
