Queries for entity Employee.

The queries marked with @service-excluded are only examples and not exposed through a service operation.



@single-result: means the query returns a single instance (instead of a List).

@service-excluded: this query will not be exposed as a method in the 
                   generated service class.  

@group: in java, group the method for this query with other methods that 
        return the specified type.
